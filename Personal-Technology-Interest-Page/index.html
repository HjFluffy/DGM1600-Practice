     <h3>How to code</h3>
        <p>I am most excited to learn how to code because I think it will help me learn how to better understand the design process
    Seeing how the work flow is for developers may help me reflect on improving designs. I will know how to work better with developers 
    because I will know how to communicate issues that can be had with code.
